# episode-picker
I'm a pretty indecisive person and love to rewatch tons of shows. I created this tool to help with my indecisiveness!

So, basically what this program does is ask you how many seasons are in the show and how many episodes are in each season.
After receiving input, a random season and episode will be spewed out.
It's really a very simple program but it's very useful for someone like me who can never make up their mind!
